# Locutus

A home automation project inspired by the Borg from Star Trek. A collective of devices and services collaborating as a whole.

## Introduction

"Locutus of Borg" was the Borg designation forced upon Starfleet captain Jean-Luc Picard after his assimilation in late 2366.

To prevent your home from becoming an uncontrolled entity, Locutus is there to save the day. The human factor in an ecosystem of things that should make life easier. He's also to blame when things go wrong because of his human side. Give him the benefit of the doubt and enjoy his creations.
