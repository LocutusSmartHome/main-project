# Locutus

A home automation project inspired by the Borg from Star Trek. A collective of devices and services collaborating as a whole.

## Introduction

"Locutus of Borg" was the Borg designation forced upon Starfleet captain Jean-Luc Picard after his assimilation in late 2366.

To prevent your home from becoming an uncontrolled entity, Locutus is there to save the day. The human factor in an ecosystem of things that should make life easier. He's also to blame when things go wrong because of his human side. Give him the benefit of the doubt and enjoy his creations.

## YAHAS?

Yet Another Home Automation System? Actually yes ;-)

Not downplaying Apple Homekit, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, IFTTT, Home Assistant, SmartThings, OpenHAB, etc. etc. as they are all great solutions.

And you also need some additional software or plugins of course, but luckily the web is filled with solutions regarding this matter. So if you're looking for integration with a Smart Home Controller, it's probably out there.

But Locutus is born out of a *not invented here syndrome*. 

Of course, always on the lookout for solutions that fellow developers have committed and then build upon that. Furthermore there's no pressure, because the current running home automation system based on node-red fulfils the need. But there's always room for improvement.

The main reason Locutus exists is because it's fun to work on.
